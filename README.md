# Folder-Opener

## Description
The `Folder Opener` is a simple batch script that allows you to open folders from the command line. It prompts the user to enter a folder name and attempts to open it. If the folder does not exist or the user does not have the necessary permissions to open it, the script will provide an appropriate error message.

## Usage
1. Open a command prompt in the directory where the `Folder Opener` script is located.(or open .bat with cmd like normal will allow you to skip #2)
2. Run the script by typing its name and pressing `Enter`.
3. When prompted, enter the name of the folder you want to open and press `Enter`.

## Notes
- If the folder does not exist, the script will display the message "The folder does not exist."
